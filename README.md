# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Module4-Project
This is a repository for Coursera's course on Getting and Cleaning Data Module 4.

The assignment uses the data from: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our abilities to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

This repository contains the following files:
1. **run_analysis.R :** which is the main R script that has the following elements as mentioned in the course requirements:
-  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
-  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2.  **FinalData.txt :** this is the final tidied data that was export from RStudio to a text file.
3. **codebook.md :** a codebook that contains all the variables, data, and summaries.
